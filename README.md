# Discharge-variability-river-mobility
Code for the paper "Accelerated river mobility linked to water discharge variability", submitted by Leenman et al., 2024. Will update this page with DOI when I have one. If you use this code, please cite the paper.

Data produced by script 1 and used in scripts 2 and 3 can be downloaded from Zenodo: https://zenodo.org/doi/10.5281/zenodo.12193791.

This repository contains 3 files:


**1_Compute_flow_signatures:** Code to compute flow signatures (metrics for discharge variability) from daily discharge records. 

**2_Paper_plots:** Code to generate figures in the main manuscript. 

**3_SM_plots:** Code to generate figures and tables used in the supporting material.


These files are R markdown files; they are designed to be run within an R project and so file paths are relative.
